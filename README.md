Basic Authentication Android App
This Android application, developed in Java, demonstrates basic authentication functionality. It includes a simple user interface with an EditText for entering an ID and a Button to submit it. Upon submission, the app verifies if the entered ID matches a predefined value. It displays a success message using a TextView for correct matches and a failure message for incorrect entries.
